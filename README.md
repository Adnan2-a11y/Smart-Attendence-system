## Introduction

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based application that leverages the power of OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library to detect and recognize faces in real-time. It logs the attendance of recognized individuals into an Excel file, making it easy to track attendance over time.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Logs attendance with date and time.
- Stores attendance data in an Excel file.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Configurable list of students with their roll numbers.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`
- `face_recognition`
- `openpyxl`
- `numpy`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition openpyxl numpy
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd face-recognition-attendance-system
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Place the student images in the `student_images` folder. The images should be named after the students (e.g., `Jafir.jpg`, `Hasib.jpg`).

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python attendance_system.py
   ```

2. The webcam feed will open, and the system will start detecting faces. Recognized faces will be logged into the `attendance.xlsx` file.

3. Press `q` to exit the application.

## Configuration

You can configure the list of students and their roll numbers by modifying the `name_to_roll` dictionary in the script:

```python
name_to_roll = {
    "Jafir": 3,
    "Hasib": 10,
    "Hasan": 26,
    "Rafi": 18,
    "Masrafi": 25,
    "Md.Sanzis Hasnat": 26,
    "Md.Rafshan Jani": 27
}
```

You can also change the path to the student images and the name of the Excel file by modifying the following variables:

```python
path = 'student_images'
excel_file = 'attendance.xlsx'
```
